This project is a planned to be a set of tips/tricks/demos that will use the Telerik UI for Windows Universal Platform (UWP).  

This means that you'll have an external dependency on the Telerik UWP SDK referenced to build it.

Required Version:
As of writing this, I am using the first release Q1 2016 (2016.1.113.45).
